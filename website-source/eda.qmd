## Introduction

This page presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a CryptoCurrency and Investing subreddit data, focusing on data cleaning and exploring user activity in relation to market data. The analysis begins by ensuring the dataset's integrity, followed by exploring the content, such as popular posts and comments, and their relation stock and security prices.

By combining Reddit discussions with market data, this part of the analysis aims to uncover patterns between user engagement and market movements, offering insights into how online conversations might influence or reflect investing trends.

## Data Overview and Quality Check


The data used for the analysis consists of posts and comments from the CryptoCurrency subreddit, sourced from a subset of the Reddit Archive data. The comments dataset has 17 columns, with the most important being author, body, score, created_utc (timestamp), and parent_id for comment threads. The submissions dataset contains 21 columns, with key ones being author, created_utc, score, title, num_comments, and selftext. Both datasets rely on created_utc for analyzing timing and user activity patterns.

In order to check the quality of the data, a number of quality checks and cleaning processes were performed. First, for the submissions/posts data, null values were counted across all columns, both for numeric and non-numeric fields. It showed that there were not any nulls in columns of significance that would invalidate that post for any reason. Then rows with titles shorter than three characters were filtered out, to remove posts without substance. The reason the limit was set to three characters is that some of the cryptocurrency and stock symbols are three charcters long, and we wanted to avoid removing any such mentions. Additionally, the number of rows and columns was checked, and rows with the title "[removed]" were counted, but none were present. The final size of the posts data after cleaning came out to 205,391x21. For the comments data, similar processes were conducted, but with a focus on the body of the comment. For the comments, there were some that had a body of "[removed]", and those were removed from the dataset. The final size of the comments data after cleaning came out to 3,667,315x17.


## CryptoCurrency Subreddit Analysis

### Most common words on the CryptoCurrency on sub reddit.

#### Process

Using PySpark, the text of post titles and comment bodies was first converted to lowercase, split into individual words, and processed for relevance. A custom stop words list, which included both standard English stop words and context-specific terms like "get," "need," and ">", was used to filter out irrelevant words. Each title and comment was split into an array of words, and stop words were removed with PySpark's StopWordsRemover function. The remaining words were then "exploded" to create a separate row for each word, facilitating an accurate count of each term's frequency. This word count data was then sorted in descending order to display the most common terms.

#### Analysis


The analysis of word frequencies highlights the CryptoCurrency subreddit community's main interests. In both post titles and comments, terms like "crypto," "bitcoin," and "btc" dominate, showing a strong focus on general cryptocurrency discussions and key assets. Titles include terms like "binance," "wallet," "exchange," and "trading," indicating practical topics like trading tools, platforms, and investment strategies, along with "price," "market," and "buy," which reflect a keen interest in market trends and guidance.

In comments, terms such as "like," "people," and "think" reflect an interactive community, where opinions, sentiments, and advice are frequently shared. Unique terms like "moons" suggest the culture of crypto discussions and meme references within the community. Overall, these findings reveal the subredditâ€™s focus on major cryptocurrencies, trading tools, and community-driven discussions around trends and market activities.


### Cryptocurrencies most frequently mentioned on Subseddit.

#### Process

Since word counts for posts and comments were already done in the process of the previous goal, the mentions of the top cryptocurrencies can easily be extrated from the general word counts. 12 of the most popular cryptocurrencies according to multiple online sources were looked, and the results can be seen below.

Unsuprisingly, Bitcoin leads discussions on the CryptoCurrency subreddit by a large margin, with the highest mention counts in both posts and comments, signaling it as the most popular topic. Ethereum and Binance also rank high, reflecting strong interest. Solana, XRP, and Cardano have moderate mentions, suggesting growing community attention, while Polygon, Dogecoin, and Tether appear less frequently, showing niche interest. Overall, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance dominate, while emerging tokens like Solana indicate shifting trends.

### How cryptocurreny prices affect the number of posts and comments on the CryptoCurrencies reddit.


Using PySpark, the data from the CryptoCurrencies subreddit, including post timestamps and comment counts, was first merged with cryptocurrency price data from external sources. Two sets of price data was used, daily Bitcoin prices over time which were sourced from github, and the S&P Cryptocurrency Broad Digital Market Index, is intended to monitor the performance of digital assets listed on reputable open digital exchanges and was sourced from S&P Global website. The timestamps of posts and comments were then matched with the corresponding cryptocurrency prices at the time of posting. Data preprocessing included converting timestamps to a common format and handling missing or outlier values in both price and comment data. After aligning the data, the variables were plotted to see how they matched up against each other over time and if any trends could be noticed.

As can be seen in the graphs, suprisingly, at least in the time frame of the given data, there does not seem to be an increase in activity on the CryptoCurrency sub reddit when the price of Bitcoin and CryptoCurrencies in general are higher. The S&P index almost mirrors the price of Bitcoin, which makes sense as Bitcoin is by far the biggest cryptocurrency and makes up the majority of the crypto market. But the most activity on the subreddit occured when prices for Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies were at their lowest. And as the prices increased, activity decreased. The reason for this decrease could be related to increased prices, as people may be more likely to post and engage in the subreddit when prices are down due to worries or potential opportunity to invest and make gains, but there are also likely other factors in play, such as news or new regulations. Further analysis would need to be conducted to say what drives increased acticity on the sub reddit, but it can at least be said that there does not seem to be a positive correlation between sub reddit activity and crypto prices.
