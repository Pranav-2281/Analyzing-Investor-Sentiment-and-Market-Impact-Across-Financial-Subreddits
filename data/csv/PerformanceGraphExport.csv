PERFORMANCE DISCLOSURE/BACK-TESTED DATA

Source: S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC.

The launch date of the S&P Cryptocurrency Broad Digital Market Index (USD) was July 13, 2021. 

Where applicable, S&P Dow Jones Indices and its index-related affiliates (“S&P DJI”) defines various dates to assist our clients by providing transparency. The First Value Date is the first day for which there is a calculated value (either live or back-tested) for a given index. The Base Date is the date at which the index is set to a fixed value for calculation purposes. The Launch Date designates the date when the values of an index are first considered live: index values provided for any date or time period prior to the index’s Launch Date are considered back-tested. S&P DJI defines the Launch Date as the date by which the values of an index are known to have been released to the public, for example via the company’s public website or its data feed to external parties. For Dow Jones-branded indices introduced prior to May 31, 2013, the Launch Date (which prior to May 31, 2013, was termed “Date of introduction”) is set at a date upon which no further changes were permitted to be made to the index methodology, but that may have been prior to the Index’s public release date.

Please refer to the methodology for the Index for more details about the index, including the manner in which it is rebalanced, the timing of such rebalancing, criteria for additions and deletions, as well as all index calculations.

Information presented prior to an index’s launch date is hypothetical back-tested performance, not actual performance, and is based on the index methodology in effect on the launch date. However, when creating back-tested history for periods of market anomalies or other periods that do not reflect the general current market environment, index methodology rules may be relaxed to capture a large enough universe of securities to simulate the target market the index is designed to measure or strategy the index is designed to capture. For example, market capitalization and liquidity thresholds may be reduced. In addition, forks have not been factored into the back-test data with respect to the S&P Cryptocurrency Indices. For the S&P Cryptocurrency Top 5 & 10 Equal Weight Indices, the custody element of the methodology was not considered; the back-test history is based on the index constituents that meet the custody element as of the Launch Date. Also, the treatment of corporate actions in back-tested performance may differ from treatment for live indices due to limitations in replicating index management decisions. Back-tested performance reflects application of an index methodology and selection of index constituents with the benefit of hindsight and knowledge of factors that may have positively affected its performance, cannot account for all financial risk that may affect results and may be considered to reflect survivor/look ahead bias. Actual returns may differ significantly from, and be lower than, back-tested returns. Past performance is not an indication or guarantee of future results.

Typically, when S&P DJI creates back-tested index data, S&P DJI uses actual historical constituent-level data (e.g., historical price, market capitalization, and corporate action data) in its calculations. As ESG investing is still in early stages of development, certain datapoints used to calculate certain ESG indices may not be available for the entire desired period of back-tested history. The same data availability issue could be true for other indices as well. In cases when actual data is not available for all relevant historical periods, S&P DJI may employ a process of using “Backward Data Assumption” (or pulling back) of ESG data for the calculation of back-tested historical performance. “Backward Data Assumption” is a process that applies the earliest actual live data point available for an index constituent company to all prior historical instances in the index performance. For example, Backward Data Assumption inherently assumes that companies currently not involved in a specific business activity (also known as “product involvement”) were never involved historically and similarly also assumes that companies currently involved in a specific business activity were involved historically too. The Backward Data Assumption allows the hypothetical back-test to be extended over more historical years than would be feasible using only actual data. For more information on “Backward Data Assumption” please refer to the FAQ. The methodology and factsheets of any index that employs backward assumption in the back-tested history will explicitly state so. The methodology will include an Appendix with a table setting forth the specific data points and relevant time period for which backward projected data was used. Index returns shown do not represent the results of actual trading of investable assets/securities. S&P DJI maintains the index and calculates the index levels and performance shown or discussed but does not manage any assets.

Index returns do not reflect payment of any sales charges or fees an investor may pay to purchase the securities underlying the Index or investment funds that are intended to track the performance of the Index. The imposition of these fees and charges would cause actual and back-tested performance of the securities/fund to be lower than the Index performance shown. As a simple example, if an index returned 10% on a US $100,000 investment for a 12-month period (or US $10,000) and an actual asset-based fee of 1.5% was imposed at the end of the period on the investment plus accrued interest (or US $1,650), the net return would be 8.35% (or US $8,350) for the year. Over a three-year period, an annual 1.5% fee taken at year end with an assumed 10% return per year would result in a cumulative gross return of 33.10%, a total fee of US $5,375, and a cumulative net return of 27.2% (or US $27,200).

ESG INDICES DISCLAIMER

S&P DJI provides indices that seek to select, exclude, and/or weight index constituents based on, but not limited to, certain environmental, social or governance (ESG) indicators, or a combination of those indicators, including the following: environmental indicators (including the efficient use of natural resources, the production of waste, greenhouse gas emissions, or impact on biodiversity); social indicators (such as, inequality and investment in human capital); governance indictors (such as sound management structures, employee relations, remuneration of staff, tax compliance, respect for human rights, anti-corruption and anti-bribery matters), specific sustainability or values-related company involvement indicators (for example, production/distribution of controversial weapons, tobacco products, or thermal coal), or controversies monitoring (including research of media outlets to identify companies involved in ESG-related incidents).  

S&P DJI ESG indices use ESG metrics and scores in the selection and/or weighting of index constituents. ESG scores or ratings seek to measure or evaluate a company’s, or an asset’s, performance with respect to environmental, social and corporate governance issues.

The ESG scores, ratings, and other data used in S&P DJI ESG indices is supplied directly or indirectly by third parties (note these parties can be independent affiliates of S&P Global or unaffiliated entities) so an S&P DJI ESG index’s ability to reflect ESG factors depends on these third parties’ data accuracy and availability.

ESG scores, ratings, and other data may be reported (meaning that the data is provided as disclosed by companies, or an asset, or as made publicly available), modelled (meaning that the data is derived using a proprietary modelling process with only proxies used in the creation of the data), or reported and modelled (meaning that the data is either a mix of reported and modelled data or is derived from the vendor using reported data /information in a proprietary scoring or determination process).

ESG scores, ratings, and other data, whether from an external and/or internal source, is based on a qualitative and judgmental assessment, especially in the absence of well-defined market standards, and due to the existence of multiple approaches and methodologies to assess ESG factors and considerations. An element of subjectivity and discretion is therefore inherent in any ESG score, rating, or other data and different ESG scoring, rating, and/or data sources may use different ESG assessment or estimation methodologies. Different persons (including ESG data ratings, or scoring providers, index administrators or users) may arrive at different conclusions regarding the sustainability or impact of a particular company, asset, or index.

Where an index uses ESG scores, ratings or other data supplied directly or indirectly by third parties, S&P DJI does not accept responsibility for the accuracy of completeness of such ESG scores, ratings, or data. No single clear, definitive test or framework (legal, regulatory, or otherwise) exists to determine ‘ESG’, ‘sustainable’, ‘good governance’, ‘no adverse environmental, social and/or other impacts’, or other equivalently labelled objectives. In the absence of well-defined market standards and due to the existence of multitude approaches, the exercise of judgment is necessary. Accordingly, different persons may classify the same investment, product and/or strategy differently regarding ‘ESG’, ‘sustainable’, ‘good governance’, ‘no adverse environmental, social and/or other impacts’, or other equivalently labelled objectives. Furthermore, the legal and/or market position on what constitutes an ‘ESG’, ‘sustainable’, ‘good governance’, ‘no adverse environmental, social and/or other impacts’, or other equivalently labelled objectives may change over time, especially as further regulatory or industry rules and guidance are issued and the ESG sustainable finance framework becomes more sophisticated.

Prospective users of an S&P DJI ESG Index are encouraged to read the relevant index methodology and related disclosures carefully to determine whether the index is suitable for their potential use case or investment objective.",,,,,,,,,
